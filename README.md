# 🎉 Hello GitHub

This is my first GitHub repository! I'm starting my journey into fullstack development and learning how to build and share my own projects from scratch — for free :D

It includes a button that shows an alert when clicked.

### 🔧 Technologies Used

Open `index.html` in your browser and click the button!


### 📌 What's Next?
