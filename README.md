#  Hello GitHub

This is my first GitHub repository, learning how to build and share my own projects from scratch â€” for free with online sources ofc :D

##  Project Description

This is a simple webpage built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It includes a button that shows an alert when clicked.

###  What I Learned

- How to create a GitHub repo and push local code
- How to link HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- How to commit and manage code changes with GitHub Desktop


### Test It Yourself

Open `index.html` in your browser and see for yourself.


### Future Plans

- Add more interactive elements (like changing text or colors)
- Try deploying this on GitHub Pages
- Start building mini projects and documenting each one here!
